From the logistical point of view, the purpose of this assignment is twofold. On one hand,
you will work with data.frames/tibbles and producing plots but now using the packages
"dplyr" and "ggplot2". On the other hand, we want you to start working with a more
complex file structure. Moreover, instead of submitting a combo of Rmd-html files to bCourses,
you will have to upload all the files to your Github Classroom Repository.  

Motivation
In this assignment, you are going to consider different ways to rank the NBA teams. From
simple rankings based on a given observed variable, to rankings based on derived indices like
efficiency (i.e. EFF) or any other composite index.
To make things more interesting, let’s pretend that the NBA does not work the way it does.
Let’s also pretend that the only available data is the player statistics, and nothing else. In
other words, we don’t know the number of wins (and losses) of each team, or which team
won the championship. Moreover, let’s assume there is no such championship. All we have is
the information about the players, and the goal is to find a ranking for the teams.
If these assumptions and the ranking idea seem awkward, think about the ranking systems
of universities, the ranking of companies in a certain industry, or the ranking of countries
according to some economic or socio-demographic indicators (see examples below):  
• U.S. News National University Rankings  
• U.S. News Overall Best Countries Ranking  
• Fortune Tech The 30 Best Workplaces in Technology
